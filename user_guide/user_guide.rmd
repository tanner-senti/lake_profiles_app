### **Introduction** 

This application is designed to interactively visualize lake profile data collected by Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). 

\
Disclaimer: This app and all data available here are DRAFTS.
The source code that this application was developed from and additional information for the original application are available via the [Utah DWQ Lake Profile Dashboard GitHub repository](https://github.com/utah-dwq/LakeProfileDashboard).
This application is available under an [MIT license](https://github.com/utah-dwq/LakeProfileDashboard/blob/master/LICENSE).
<br> 

**Deploying the app and hosting:** 

Currently this app utilizes [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io/) to host and deploy on a publicly accessible URL.
Due to hosting restrictions this app can only handle limited web traffic.
If the app becomes unavailable, please contact [ADEQ's Water Quality Planning Branch](https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/water/planning/) for access to lake profile data. 
<br> 

**Data** 

Data must be updated by ADEQ manually.
Data will be updated quarterly each year and will be reflective of the lake profiles collected during that time. 

The data used in this application are collected as water column profiles at lake sites throughout Arkansas.
Lake profiles consist of measurements of dissolved oxygen (mg/L), temperature (°C), and pH at regular depth intervals through the water column.
Data have been pre-processed to ensure consistency in parameter names and units.
<br> 

**Application usage** 

The application has two main inputs: a map and a table of sites with data.
To build plots for any individual site, click on your desired site in either the map or the table. 

By default, only the sites with available data are shown.
The map and table inputs are responsive to each other, and thus when you click a site on the map the table will automatically filter to profile data associated with that site.
When you click on a row in the table, the map will automatically direct you to that site location. 

Plots and outputs specific to that site will be rendered automatically any time the user updates one of the input widgets.
<br> 

**Map elements** 

Individual lake monitoring locations are displayed as blue circle markers on the map.
Only locations with available data will be shown.
While all lake monitoring sites are available as a map layer, not all sites will have routinely monitored vertical depth profile data.
Topographic and satellite base layers are also both available.
To turn on any of these layers, hover the mouse over the layers control box and select one or more layers (Figure 1).

### **Outputs** 

**Profile data table**

On the left side of the app, underneath the map is a profile data table.
This table will display the raw data that is used to produce the plot(s) currently visible on screen.
The table will update dynamically depending on plot tab and date filter selections.
Additionally, directly underneath the data table is a button to download a .CSV file of the data currently shown.

**Individual profiles** 

The "Individual profiles" tab displays a single profile collected at the selected site and date.
This single lake profile plots dissolved oxygen (mg/L), temperature (°C), and pH against depth (m).
Above the plot is a date selection drop-down with all available dates for the selected location.
<br>

**Site profiles (all dates)** 

The "Site profiles (all dates)" tab shows three outputs for a single site.
Plots of dissolved oxygen (mg/L), pH, and temperature (°C) against depth (m) are displayed across all available dates.
The date ranges used in these plots can be adjusted with the date range drop-downs at the top of the page (Figure 2).

**Site profiles by year**

The "Site profiles by year" tab shows three outputs for a single site.
This tab separates each plot by parameter (dissolved oxygen (mg/L), pH, and temperature (°C)) with all the data displayed for a given calendar year.
Above the plots is a year selection drop-down to specify which calendar year of data to display (Figure 3).
