This Lakes profile app will interactively plot profile data. All data come from here: 
E:\LAKES\Quarterly Lakes Study\2023 - 2026 Lakes Study\Lake Profiles\lake_profiles_graphing

The project above will clean Sonde data and create one data file for use with this app. This must
be done manually each time to get new data on the app.

Running the app:
Simply make sure all relevant packages are installed, then open the "app.R" file and click
Run App in the top right corner of RStudio.

A deployed example of this app is available at: https://i24os8-tanner-senti.shinyapps.io/ADEQ_Lakes_Profiles/
